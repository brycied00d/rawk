<h1>brokenlcd's guide to setting up sites with rawk</h1>
<p>
<em>this is not the only way to do this, it's just how i do it.</em></p>
<h2>step 0: pre-requisites</h2>
<ol>
<li><p>
you need a markdown parser installed. see the readme for the link for smu,
the markdown parser i use.</p>
</li>
<li><p>
rawk should be installed to your system path. for the sake of this tutorial,
we'll assume that rawk is installed in /usr/local (i.e. the script is at 
/usr/local/bin/rawk). this should be done with the include makefile, which will
copy over site templates.</p>
</li>
<li><p>
i assume you have a working webserver - i won't cover apache or lighttpd or 
nginx or whatever web server you're using or how to get dns set up.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>step 1: preparing the site</h2>
<ol>
<li><p>
first you should create a project directory. i name mine with the domain
name, i.e. rawk.brokenlcd.net. for the same of this document, we'll call this
directory $project. now cd $project. </p>
</li>
<li><p>
create a directory in $project to contain the site src. we'll call this 
$site. for example, mkdir rawk_site. you can add a quick $site/index.md to 
test the site: <code>echo it works &gt; $site/index.md</code>. </p>
</li>
<li><p>
copy over the skeleton files: <code>cp -r /usr/local/share/rawk/site/* .</code>
these files should be in $project. in $project/ you should have $site,
Makefile, rawkrc, and templates. in this example, </p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>step 2: initial configuration</h2>
<ol>
<li>edit the Makefile:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>
changing SITE to contain the folder $site. for this site
it would be SITE=rawk_site.</p>
</li>
<li><p>
change RHOST to point to where you will upload the site to. it will be 
similar to the line in the makefile. <em>make sure you have a trailing slash!</em></p>
<p>
  2. edit rawkrc. for now, you just have to edit site_title and site_subtitle.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>step 3: set up version control</h2>
<ol>
<li><p>
this step is quite optional but <strong>strongly</strong> recommended.</p>
</li>
<li><p>
you should use whatever version control system you are happy with. i like
git, some other good scms are mercurial and fossil.</p>
</li>
<li><p>
it is strongly recommended that you only track changes to $site. the
makefile will generate $site.build; this should be ignored.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>step 4: add content</h2>
<ol>
<li><p>
all the site content goes in $site</p>
</li>
<li><p>
all .md files will be converted to .html - index.md -&gt; index.html, 
about.md -&gt; about.html, etc...</p>
</li>
<li><p>
rawk copies everything over to build directory but doesn't touch anything
but markdown files. this means <em>anything</em> in $site will be pushed to your site.</p>
</li>
<li><p>
when creating links to other pages in your markdown files, be sure to use
page.html instead of page.md.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>step 5: build and publish</h2>
<ol>
<li><p>
now it's time to use that makefile you edited in step 2.</p>
</li>
<li><p>
from inside $project (where the makefile should be), issuing <code>make</code> or
<code>make site</code> should build your site. if you list the directory after the make,
you should see a $site.build directory. this contains a static html version
of $site.</p>
</li>
<li><p>
<code>make install</code> to rsync your site to RHOST.</p>
</li>
<li><p>
<code>make clean</code> to remove the build directory.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>step 6: enjoy</h2>
<p>
your site should be up and running now. you are free to focus on content and
not on a framework.</p>
