brokenlcd's guide to setting up sites with rawk
===============================================

*this is not the only way to do this, it's just how i do it.*

step 0: pre-requisites
----------------------
1. you need a markdown parser installed. see the readme for the link for smu,
the markdown parser i use.

2. rawk should be installed to your system path. for the sake of this tutorial,
we'll assume that rawk is installed in /usr/local (i.e. the script is at 
/usr/local/bin/rawk). this should be done with the include makefile, which will
copy over site templates.

step 1: preparing the site
--------------------------

1. first you should create a project directory. i name mine with the domain
name, i.e. rawk.brokenlcd.net. for the same of this document, we'll call this
directory $project. now cd $project. 

2. create a directory in $project to contain the site src. we'll call this 
$site. for example, mkdir rawk_site. you can add a quick $site/index.md to 
test the site: `echo it works > $site/index.md`. 

3. copy over the skeleton files: `cp -r /usr/local/share/rawk/site/* .`
these files should be in $project. in $project/ you should have $site,
Makefile, rawkrc, and templates. in this example, 

step 2: initial configuration
-----------------------------

1. edit the Makefile, changing SITE to contain the folder $site. for this site
it would be SITE=rawk_site.

2. change RHOST to point to where you will upload the site to.
