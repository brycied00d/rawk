this is the source to the official rawk site. it serves as an example of how
a site build might look, as well as verification of the rawk tools. i use this
to debug rawk and to make sure that it generates everything properly. 

in short, this directory is the test suite for rawk. after installing rawk, you
should be able to run 'make' and verify that the site was generated. note that
due to the way rawk generates the code, it will need to be installed on the
site for stylesheets and links to work.
