=================

[sourceforge profile](https://sourceforge.net/projects/rawk-sh/) - contains a
release tarball and support pages.
[github page](https://github.com/kisom/rawk) - the latest cutting edge code 
goes here.
[rawk's trac page](https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/rawk-sh/) - submit support
tickets or edit the wiki.
[laconica profile](https://sourceforge.net/apps/laconica/rawk-sh/) - quick
updates on what's going on with the project.
[rss feed](https://sourceforge.net/export/rss2_keepsake.php?group_id=402443) -
follow the current sourceforge activity.
[smu](http://s01.de/~tox/index.cgi/proj_smu) - smu is my preferred markdown
parser, but you can use whichever one you wish.

rawk development is centered around sourceforge. the latest code is always
synced to github, but is often pushed to the sourceforge git repository as
well. the sourceforge page is home to all of the support resources and 
current release tarballs (for those without git).
