rage against web frameworks
---------------------------

rawk is a static site generator written in the bourne shell. it uses posix
compliant syntax to support the maximum number of systems and requires only
a markdown parser and the standard unix tools (grep and sed in particular).

rawk should be fed a tree containing markdown files and any other components
to the site. it will copy that tree over to a build directory and convert
all markdown files to full pages to create a site with consistent headers,
footers, and a context menu of sorts.
